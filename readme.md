## Summary

My second project using primarily Javascript and formatted with HTML and CSS, and my first one that is in any way interactive for the user.

It was good practice with fundamentals like adding event listeners, passing variables, and using conditional statements and logical operators within functions.

The javascript went through a number of different iterations while I was not only building the program, but then also refining and condensing the code to make it "cleaner", more efficient, and less buggy. More challenging than I expected but I'm proud of the work.
