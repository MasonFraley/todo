## Summary

My third project using primarily Javascript and formatted with HTML and CSS, and my second one that is in any way interactive for the user.

This project was heavier on the use of JS methods than what I've done before, so it was a steep learning curve but I'm happy with what came out- simple AND functional.

Similair to my rock-paper-scissors app, the javascript went through a few dramatic overhauls while I was deciding how to approach the problem. Again, definitely a little more challenging than I expected but absolutely experience worth having.

I went which a Matrix-esque aesthetic because I had watched that the other day before finishing the project. :)
